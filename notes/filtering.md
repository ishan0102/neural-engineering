# Filtering

## Basics
- **Nyquist theorem** states that the max frequency signal measurable is half of the sampling rate (since you need two points to accurately reconstruct one period)

## Connection to Brain
- we know that certain frequencies only occur in certain parts of the brain
- we can apply **band pass filtering** to increase the **signal to noise ratio** of the raw signal
- transform the raw EEG signal into a domain (usually frequency) that lets us observe emergent properties
	- during recording time we can mark instances of when something happened (markers) to correlate action -> signal observation
