# Lecture 5: Deep Brain Stimulation
## History of DBS
### Parkinson's Disease
- neurodegenerative disease that kills brain cells/neurons of the basal ganglia (substantia nigra) in the brain stem
- slowly affects movement, muscle control, and balance

## Electrophysiological Principles of DBS
- rheobase current: minimum current such that the neural element will be stimulated
- chronaxie: pulse duration needed to evoke 2x the rheobase current
  - very fast (microseconds)
- DBS most likely affects efferent myelinated axons
- stimulation parameters are tuned during post-op
  - only open-loop (permanent) simulation is currently implemented
- effects of DBS depend on nonlinear relationship between stimulus duration and voltage
  - voltage is applied by DBS electrode
- myelinated axons of intermediate neural elements most likely receive the effects of stimulation
  - clinical DBS parameters usually stimulate a large volume of tissue
