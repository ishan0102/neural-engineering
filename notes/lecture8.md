# Lecture 8: Hearing

## The Human Ear
- sounds enter through the ear and reaches the tympanic membrane to create vibrations
- these vibrations are then amplified and the cochlea transduces the vibrations into neural signals
  - this process is possible due to the movement of hair, these hair cells are like piano keys in a spiral shape that can be bent by the vibrations

### Tonotopic Encoding
- the cochlea is tonotopically organized, meaning that the frequency of the sound is encoded in the location of the hair cells
  - cells at the base of the cochlea are sensitive to low frequencies and cells at the top are sensitive to high frequencies
- this is the start of an **auditory pathway** that reaches the auditory cortex
- every level of the auditory brain has a tonotopic organization
  - inferior colliculus, cochlear nucleus, and auditory cortex
  - at each subnucleus, nerve cells that respond to low vs. high frequencies are at opposite ends

## Hearing Solutions
- hearing aids: amplifies sound
  - with age, we are all losing sensitivity
- middle ear implants: generates vibrations that the middle ear can't
- cochlear implants: generates electrical stimulation for the auditory nerve
- brainstem implants: generates electrical signals after the cochlea

## Cochlea
- the cochlea is completely developed at birth
  - no need of replacement
- degree of deafness does not affect the length or volume of the cochlea, while it can affect other aspects like height
- high-resolution computed tomography lets us see this

## Cochlear Implant
- generate artificial electrical signals by encoding sound into electrical signals using a speech processor
- **cochlear electrodes** are made from crinkled lead wires that increase flexibility
- there are almost a million of these implanted worldwide
- neuroplasticity makes the brain adapt to the new signals, originally sounds electronic but becomes more natural over time

### Surgery
- very challenging, need to enter the cochlea and insert the electrode
- material needs to be stiff to enter the cochlea yet compliant enough to bend around the cochlea
- improving in imaging methods makes it possible to design an electrode array to better match the tonotopic frequency distribution
  - if the placement is bad, the frequency mapping will be wrong

### Early Interventions
- children respond better than adults
- early experiences have a decisive impact on the brain architecture
- newborn brains only have 25% of the adult brain volume -> number of synapses grows more than tenfold
- brain can also learn what the signals should sound like and can learn to recognize speech well
