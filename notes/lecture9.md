# Lecture 9: Neuroplasticity

## Plasticity and BMI
- neurons used to control a BMI are in the motor cortex and respond maximally to the intended movement
  - neurons encode the intended movement naturally
- we observe motor cortex reorganization after training rats on new tasks
  - then we can map lesions to disabilities and observe recovery
- **bilateral amputation**: we observe motor reorganization during left / right hand activation using fMRI
- **animal studies**: we see somatotopic reorganization of the fingers
