# Lecture 3: Functional Electrical Stimulation

## Paraplegia
- restrictions in respiratory function, bladder/sexual function, mobility of limbs due to innervation

## Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)
- innervated muscles can be stimulated through external electrical impulses
- paralyzed muscles can be trained long term
- we use **functional electrical stimulation** for motor restitution

### Field Propagation
- ions located in the tissue move
- ion flow depends on tissue conductivity -> therapeutic effectiveness parameter is the charge density
	- brain conductivity is much higher than skeletal muscle conductivity

## FES: Nerves and Muscles
- electrical stimulation activate nerves rather than muscles
	- we attempt to generate an action potential in neurons since the threshold is much lower than for muscle fibers
- it is easier to activate large-diameter axons (innervating large motor units) since they have more surface area (reverse recruitment order effect)
	- opposite to physiological size principles
	- causes less muscle endurance -> more fatigue
- conditions for neuromuscular electrical stimulation: healthy lower motor neurons, neuromuscular junction, and muscle

## FES Parameters
- intensity of current
- pulse width
- frequency (stimulation rate)
- size of electrodes

### Size of Electrodes
- active electrode placement is critical for selective muscle activation
- active electrode size affects depth of stimulation
	- small electrodes target superficial excitable tissue
	- large electrodes target superficial *and deep* excitable tissue
- electrical pulses activate sensory nerves and motor neurons

## FES Risks
- unidrectional ion transport -> electrolysis effects which can cause tissue to die
- we have precautions like using currents without DC components (always moving ions back and forth), biphasic currents, and wet sponge/gel electrodes

## Surface vs. Implantable Electrodes
- **surface electrodes**: easy application, lack of selectivity, hard to stimulate low-lying muscles, increased sensitivity to pain
- **implantable electrodes**: stable, chroic application possible but demanding operation and post-treatment
	- epimysial (muscle surface), intramuscular (within muscle), epineural/cuff (adjacent/around the nerve)

### Diaphragmatic Pacemaker
- in the case of impaired respiratory function in case of paralysis above C3, you can use external artificial respiration (lifelong machine) or an implantable stimulator with epineural electrodes
	- device does "carousel" stimulation of the phrenic nerve

### Neuroprosthesis for Standing and Walking
- 6 stimulation channels for surface electrodes
- sitting -> standing, standing -> sitting, and stepping have solutions
- main problem: requires constant stimulation to allow muscle use (since your body is good at minimizing energy consumption -> use it or lose it)
	- severe muscle fatigue due to simultaneous activation of all muscle fibers and constriction of blood flow
	- unstable body position and no return of joint positions
	- these functions don't heal naturally since CNS doesn't have a natural regrowth mechanism
- no FES systems available for daily locomotion
