# Lecture 7: Vision

## Blindness
- degeneration of the retina
- blindness measurements
  - low vision: 20/70 or <20 degrees of visual field
  - legal blindness: 20/200 or <20 degrees of visual field
  - blindness: 20/400 or <10 degrees of visual field

### Inherited Outer Retinal Degeneration
- outer retinal diseases (e.g. macular degeneration) lead to degeneration of photoreceptors
- many inner retinal neurons survive, and we cannot regenerate the neurons we've lost
- use an implant to stimulate the remaining neurons

### Visual Acuity
- a measure of the capability to discriminate separate lines (i.e. **spatial resolution**)
- good test of how much degeneration has occurred
- most common clinical test is 20/20 (20 feet away, separate contours that are 1.75mm apart)

### Visual Field
- total area of the visual world that can be seen

## Visual Prostheses
- electrical stimulation was able to allow a subject to perceive a small point of light (**phosphene**) in 1929
- we stimulate a set of phosphenes and explain what letter they're seeing
  - electrical stimulation -> semantic supervised learning -> vision
- the prostheses must excite neurons of the visual pathway at some point after the damage site where there are still healthy neurons

### History of Prostheses
- 1929: basic stimulation allowed patient to see phosphenes
- 1968: 80-electrode device was implanted in a 52-year-old blind woman -> better results than previous phosphenes
- 1974: Dobelle tested various params of electrical stimulation on 37 volunteers undergoing occipital lobe surgery -> constant stimulus did not produce sustained phosphene, but one that faded over time
  - we cannot maintain a constant representation of a static object -> the brain must be constantly updating the representation or it will fill in with most likely object (this is how magicians do their tricks)
  - 4 volunteers were implanted with permanent electrode arrays, one of them wore implant for 14 years

## Cortical Visual Prostheses
- Dobelle worked on a computer vision system that took in a video stream and converted it to electrical stimulation
- users had to wear a computer
- phosphene map in the user's visual space were stable over two decades
- fast learning to recognize letters and numbers, and 20/400 visual acuity was eventually achieved

### Intracortical Visual Prostheses
- use of implanted intracortical microelectrodes leads to increased spatial resolution, lower currents, and faster frame rates
- advances beyond ECoG has allowed for more precise stimulation

## Retinal Prostheses
- retinal prostheses have regulatory approval in Europe and the US
- epiretinal places prostheses right in front of lesion (photoreceptors) and subretinal is exactly where the lesion is
  - much easier to reach in surgery than within brain
  - subretinal exploits most of the natural visual pathway and replaces lost photoreceptors but has a more complex surgery
  - epiretinal is just the last layer, lasts longer, and involves ganglion cell stimulation

## Subretinal Prostheses
- we can stimulate retinal neurons with photodiodes to replace photoreceptors
- passive photodiodes don't generate high enough currents so we need electrical or photovoltaic power
- example device is the Alpha IMS
- photovoltaic subretinal systems are better then electrical as they are less bulky and can have a wireless implant
  - implanted in simple surgery and has better visual acuity

## Optogenetic Epiretinal Prostheses
- targets retinal ganglion cells
- virus encodes light-sensing protein that fuses to cells
  - viral vector is injected into the eye directly
- there are also neuromorphic cameras that can detect changes in light intensity and project them onto the retina
